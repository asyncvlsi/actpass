# ACT Passes

The ACT hardware description framework permits users to define their own analysis passes and insert them into the silicon compilation flow.
This repository contains an example pass that can be loaded in dynamically into the `interact` interactive ACT system.

A number of existing core passes are written this way, including the layout generation passes.
